We are planning to develop a mobile application for users stuck or trapped in a place after a natural calamity has occurred, as after any place is hit by a natural disaster like floods, earthquake, etc. the people who are alive but get stuck or trapped, tend to panic due to lack of proper help and guidance required at the time of such crisis and lose their lives.
We plan to build a multi-feature application for specifically trapped/stuck natural disaster victims:
•	main feature of the app would be recognizing the severity of disaster and condition of the victim through the images taken by him/her, processing these images and return the steps he/she needs to take to tackle the situation he/she is stuck in.
•	Offline videos about how to avoid panic in various general situations like being stuck inside debris or stranded on the top of a building during a flood.
•	Synchronization with social networking applications to use features like fakebook’s marking someone safe/unsafe based on the location of the victim so that unconscious victims or people away from their phones can automatically provide their location.
•	Interactive music integrated games to keep the victim distracted.
